                            <h3>ABOUT SHE THE PEOPLE</h3>
                            <p>She the People brings together a national network of women of color —  voters, organizers, movement builders, elected leaders -- to transform our democracy. We unite under shared values — to love our own and others, to make justice the law of the land, to create a country where everyone belongs, and to make this American democracy live up to its greatest promise. As women of color — Black, Latina, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Muslim, Indigenous — we have been at the heart of the justice movements that have shaped this country. And now we are ready to govern. She the People is organizing a multiracial coalition that will lead the nation into a new political and cultural era. In swing states in the South, Southwest, and Midwest we aim to increase the voter turnout of women of color who will be the key to winning the elections.</p>

                            <h3>about the founder</h3>
                            <p>Dear Sisters,</p>
                            <p>She the People began with a dream to write the first book about women of color in politics. For three years, I studied the data and interviewed women of color organizers, strategists, and leaders across the country. The legacy of women of color is the greatest untold political story in America.  I witnessed first-hand the political power, savvy, and brilliance of women of color candidates, organizers, and strategists when I was President of Democracy in Color. Women of color transformed the political landscape of Georgia, and Black women led a winning coalition for an Alabama special Senate election. Women of color are embodying  political excellence all across the country. I founded She the People from the conviction that we need to lift each other up, we need to create spaces where we can talk to each other, and unite in the common cause of justice. Our leadership has inspired magazine covers, game changing news stories, and winning hashtags. And our work speaks to the deep need for our courage and vision in our movements. Our journey is just starting –– </p>
                            <p>From the Summit in San Francisco to the presidential forum in Houston to the debate in Miami to the town hall in Richmond. We owe a great debt to our partners –– women who work everyday to serve the people, and who organize more and more people into action and voting. You are part of a national network in She the People. All you are a party of building it. Bring your friends, your squad, and your organizations to be a part of our national effort. Join us in the quest to create new possibilities and hope for the entire nation, in 2020 and beyond. </p>
                            <p>With hope,</p>
