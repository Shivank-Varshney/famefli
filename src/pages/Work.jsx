                            <p>Dear Sisters,</p>
                            <p>She the People began with a dream to write the first book about women of color in politics. For three years, I studied the data and interviewed women of color organizers, strategists, and leaders across the country. The legacy of women of color is the greatest untold political story in America.  I witnessed first-hand the political power, savvy, and brilliance of women of color candidates, organizers, and strategists when I was President of Democracy in Color. Women of color transformed the political landscape of Georgia, and Black women led a winning coalition for an Alabama special Senate election. Women of color are embodying  political excellence all across the country. I founded She the People from the conviction that we need to lift each other up, we need to create spaces where we can talk to each other, and unite in the common cause of justice. Our leadership has inspired magazine covers, game changing news stories, and winning hashtags. And our work speaks to the deep need for our courage and vision in our movements. Our journey is just starting –– </p>
                            <p>From the Summit in San Francisco to the presidential forum in Houston to the debate in Miami to the town hall in Richmond. We owe a great debt to our partners –– women who work everyday to serve the people, and who organize more and more people into action and voting. You are part of a national network in She the People. All you are a party of building it. Bring your friends, your squad, and your organizations to be a part of our national effort. Join us in the quest to create new possibilities and hope for the entire nation, in 2020 and beyond. </p>
                            <p>With hope,</p>
                            <p>Aimee</p>
